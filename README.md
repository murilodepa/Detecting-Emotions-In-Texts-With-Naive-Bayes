# Detecting Emotions in Texts with Naive-Bayes

## Detecting emotions in texts with Naive Bayes and using library NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), written in Python.  

* Testing the algorithm with a data set (70% to train and 30% to classify), and with 6 labels, **"alegria"**, **"desgosto"**, **"medo"**, **"raiva"**, **"surpresa"** and **"tristeza"**. An accuracy of approximately 34 %. You can see the confusion matrix that the program generated. And you have the option to re-classify without ending the program.**
